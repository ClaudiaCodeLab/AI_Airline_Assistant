# üõ© FlightAI - Airline Assistant

FlightAI is a chatbot for an airline, supporting both **OpenAI GPT (API)** and **Llama 3 (via Ollama, locally)**.

## üîß Features
- **Supports OpenAI GPT with function calling** (ticket prices lookup).
- **Supports Llama 3 locally via Ollama** (manual function execution).
- **Automatically detects available model and switches accordingly.**
- **Extensible and modular** for additional airline tools.

## üéØ Objective
This implementation showcases the power of **Tools**, an incredibly powerful feature provided by frontier LLMs. Tools enable an LLM to call custom functions as part of its response, allowing for more dynamic and context-aware interactions. By integrating function calling, the assistant can:
- Fetch real-time ticket prices when requested.
- Extend its capabilities by calling additional airline-related functions.
- Provide more accurate responses by utilizing external data sources.

The implementation seamlessly supports OpenAI function calling and manually handles function execution for Llama-based models, demonstrating how different AI models can leverage structured function execution.

## üöÄ Setup Instructions
